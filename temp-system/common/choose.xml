  <title>To Boot or to Chroot?</title>

  <para> There are two different ways you can proceed from this point
  to build the final system. You can build a kernel, a bootloader, and
  a few other utilities, boot into the temporary system, and build the
  rest there. The other option is to chroot into the temporary system.</para>

  <para>The boot method is for when you are building on a different
  architecture. For example, if you are building a PowerPC system from
  an x86, you can't chroot. The chroot method is for when you are
  building on the same architecture. If you are building on, and for,
  an x86 system, you can simply chroot. The rule of thumb here is if
  the architectures match and you are running the same series kernel
  you can just chroot. If you aren't running the same series kernel, or are
  wanting to run a different ABI, you will need to use the boot option.</para>

  <para>For the boot method, follow <xref linkend="chapter-boot"/>.</para>

  <para>For the chroot method, follow <xref linkend="chapter-chroot"/>.</para>
