  <title>About Test Suites, Again</title>

  <para>In the final-system build, you are no longer cross-compiling so it
  is possible to run package testsuites. Some test suites are more important
  than others. For example,  the test suites for the core toolchain
  packages&mdash;GCC, Binutils, and Glibc&mdash;are of the utmost
  importance due to their central role in a properly functioning system.
  The test suites for GCC and Glibc can take a very long time to complete,
  especially on slower hardware, but are strongly recommended.</para>

  <para>A common issue with running the test suites for Binutils and GCC
  is running out of pseudo terminals (PTYs). This can result in a high
  number of failing tests. This may happen for several reasons, but the
  most likely cause is that the host system does not have the
  <systemitem class="filesystem">devpts</systemitem> file system set up
  correctly. This issue is discussed in greater detail at
  <ulink url="&faq-root;#no-ptys"/>.</para>

  <para>Sometimes package test suites will fail, but for reasons which the
  developers are aware of and have deemed non-critical. Consult the logs located
  at <ulink url="&test-results;"/> to verify whether or not these failures are
  expected. This site is valid for all tests throughout this book.</para>
