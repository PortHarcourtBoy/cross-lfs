  <title>Creating the $LFS/cross-tools Directory</title>

  <para>All programs compiled in <xref linkend="chapter-cross-tools"/> will
  be installed under <filename class="directory">$LFS/cross-tools</filename>
  to keep them separate from the host programs. The programs compiled here are
  cross tools and will not be a part of the final LFS system. By keeping these
  programs in a separate directory, they can easily be discarded later after
  their use.</para>

  <para>Create the required directory by running the following as
  <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>:</para>

<screen><userinput>install -d $LFS/cross-tools</userinput></screen>

  <para>The next step is to create a <filename
  class="symlink">/cross-tools</filename> symlink on the host system.
  This will point to the newly-created directory in your home directory.
  Since normal users will not have permissions to write to the root tree,
  we need to exit the <command>su</command> and run the symlink command as
  <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>:</para>

<screen><userinput>ln -s $LFS/cross-tools /</userinput></screen>

  <para>The created symlink enables the toolchain to be compiled so that
  it always refers to <filename class="directory">/cross-tools</filename>,
  meaning that the compiler, assembler, and linker will be avaialble for
  use later if some unforseen circumstances happen.</para>
