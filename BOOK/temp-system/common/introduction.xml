  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This chapter shows how to compile and install a minimal Linux
  system. This system will contain just enough tools to start
  constructing the final LFS system in <xref
  linkend="chapter-building-system"/> and allow a working environment
  with more user convenience than a minimum environment would.</para>

  <para>The tools in this chapter are cross-compiled using the toolchain in /cross-tools. The files compiled in this chapter will be installed under the
  <filename class="directory">$LFS/tools</filename> directory to keep
  them separate from the files installed in <xref
  linkend="chapter-building-system"/> and the host production directories.
  Since the packages compiled here are temporary, we do not want them to
  pollute the soon-to-be LFS system.</para>

  <para>Check one last time that the <envar>LFS</envar> environment
  variable is set up properly:</para>

<screen><userinput>echo $LFS</userinput></screen>

  <para>Make sure the output shows the path to the LFS partition's mount
  point, which is <filename class="directory">/mnt/lfs</filename>, using
  our example.</para>

  <para>During this section of the build you will see several WARNING
  messages like the one below. It is safe to ignore these messages.</para>

<blockquote><screen><computeroutput>configure: WARNING: If you wanted to set the --build type, don't use --host.
    If a cross compiler is detected then cross compile mode will be used.</computeroutput></screen></blockquote>
