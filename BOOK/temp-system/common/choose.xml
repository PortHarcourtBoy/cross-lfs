  <title>To Boot or to Chroot?</title>

  <para>The boot method is for when you are building on a different architecture.
  Like building PowerPC and x86, you can't chroot.</para>

  <para>For the boot method, follow to <xref linkend="chapter-boot"/>.</para>

  <para>The chroot method is for when you are building on the same architecture,
  Like building x86 and x86, you simply just chroot. The rule of thumb
  here is if the architectures match and you are running the same series kernel
  you can just chroot. If you aren't running the same series kernel, or are
  wanting to run a different ABI, you will need to use the boot option.</para>

  <para>For the chroot method, follow to <xref linkend="chapter-chroot"/>.</para>
