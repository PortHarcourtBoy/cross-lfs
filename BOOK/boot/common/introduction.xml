  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This chapter shows how to complete the build of temporary tools to
  create a minimal system that will be used to boot the target machine and to
  build the final system packages.</para>

  <para>There are a few additional packages that will need to be
  installed to allow you to boot the minimal system. Some of these
  packages will be installed onto the root or in /usr on the LFS
  partition ($LFS/bin, $LFS/usr/lib, etc...), rather than /tools, using the
  "DESTDIR" option with make. This will require the
  <systemitem class="username">lfs</systemitem> user to have write access to
  the rest of the $LFS partition, so you will need to temporarily change the
  ownership of $LFS to the <systemitem class="username">lfs</systemitem> user.
  Run the following command as <systemitem
  class="username">root</systemitem>:</para>

<screen><userinput>chown -v lfs $LFS</userinput></screen>
