  <title>Creating the temporary tools directories</title>

  <para>The cross-binutils and cross-compiler built in
  <xref linkend="chapter-cross-tools"/> will be installed under
  <filename class="directory">${CLFS}/cross-tools</filename> to keep them
  separate from the host programs. The programs compiled here are
  cross-tools and will not be a part of the final CLFS system or the
  temp-system. Similarly, all programs compiled in
  <xref linkend="chapter-temp-system"/> will be installed under
  <filename class="directory">${CLFS}/tools</filename> to keep them separate
  from the programs compiled in <xref linkend="chapter-building-system"/>.
  This also prevents these programs from ending up in the host production
  directories (easy to do by accident in <xref linkend="chapter-temp-system"/>).
  By keeping the cross-compile tools and temporary-system programs in separate
  directories, they can easily be discarded later after their use.</para>

  <para>Create the required directories by running the following as
  <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>:</para>

<screen><userinput>install -dv ${CLFS}/{tools,cross-tools}</userinput></screen>
