  <title>Creating the ${CLFS}/tools Directory</title>

  <para>All programs compiled in <xref linkend="chapter-temp-system"/>
  will be installed under <filename class="directory">${CLFS}/tools</filename>
  to keep them separate from the programs compiled in <xref
  linkend="chapter-building-system"/>. The programs compiled here are
  temporary tools and will not be a part of the final CLFS system. By keeping
  these programs in a separate directory, they can easily be discarded later
  after their use. This also prevents these programs from ending up in the
  host production directories (easy to do by accident in <xref
  linkend="chapter-temp-system"/>).</para>

  <para>Create the required directory by running the following as
  <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>:</para>

<screen><userinput>install -dv ${CLFS}/tools</userinput></screen>
